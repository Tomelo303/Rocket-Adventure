# RocketAdventure

A small 2D game that uses SDL2 where player(s) control a rocket.

Their mission is to fly as high as possible in the shortest amount of time, whilst avoiding obstacles and collecting boosts, such as a force shield and an improvement to the rocket's agility.

Game gets progressively harder as the player has less time to react and if they manage to reach the space, they need to avoid a harder type of obstacle.

The game can be played by up to two players, one of them uses WSAD and the other uses arrow keys.

All of the graphics (which are not present in this repository) were made by myself using graphics tablet.
